## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Flexbox & Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learn from the very basics of Javascript. Meaning from creating variables to complex topics like async/await operations, promises and make calls to an API.

Also was able to create unit tests using Jasmine library.

### Continued development

I'd like to take this to a whole new level using React.js but first, need to finish the orders and tracking pages that still work in progress.
